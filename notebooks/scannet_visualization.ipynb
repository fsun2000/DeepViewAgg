    "This notebook lets you instantiate the **[ScanNet](http://www.scan-net.org/)** dataset from scratch and visualize **3D+2D room samples**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you will need **at least 1.2T** available for the SanNet raw dataset and **at least 64G** for the processed files at **5cm voxel resolution** and **320x240 image resolution**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ScanNet dataset is composed of **rooms** of video acquisitions of indoor scenes. Thes video streams were used to produce a point cloud and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each room is small enough to be loaded at once into a **64G RAM** memory. The `ScannetDatasetMM` class from `torch_points3d.datasets.segmentation.multimodal.scannet` deals with loading the room and part of the images of the associated video stream."
